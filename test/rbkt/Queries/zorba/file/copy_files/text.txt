Summary of Simple Marked Text (MTX) Format
Version 1.5.5 - January 1997

General Considerations

  Source file names have an .mtx extension.
  HTML file names have an .html extension.
  Files contain only ASCII characters
    (return, linefeed, tab, space to ~).
  Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines. Extra blank
    lines will be eliminated. Adjacent lines will be
    combined into a single paragraph.
  Lines indented with spaces or tabs will become an item
    in a list.
  Items marked by a "N" use Netscape HTML extensions. For
    maximum compatibility, avoid these tags.
  Items marked by a "**" are depreciated. They will disappear
    in a future release of MTX and should be avoided.

  borders, blanks for empty cells, and resize to cover 95%
  of the window side to side.
