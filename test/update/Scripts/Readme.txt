To generate a report for submitting to the W3C be sure to use at least Xerces 3.1.1

0. For submitting reports to W3C one should compile Zorba with:
    ZORBA_WITH_BIG_INTEGER=ON
    ZORBA_XQUERYX=ON
    ZORBA_TEST_XQUERYX=ON
    ZORBA_TEST_W3C_TO_SUBMIT_RESULTS=ON
    ZORBA_WITH_JSON=OFF

Update the import_w3c_update_testsuite.sh by removing lines 136, 139 and 140.

1.  Import XQUTS.

2.  Run a CTest dashboard from your build directory:

    ctest -T test -R w3c_update_testsuite/XQuery -E XQueryX or
    ctest -T test -R w3c_update_testsuite/XQueryX

3.  From this directory (test/rbkt/Scripts/w3c), modify
    generate-submission-xquts.xq to reflect:

    - the node 'implementation', attribute 'version' - the version of Zorba and the svn revision tested
    - node 'syntax' - either XQuery or XQueryX
    - node 'test-run', attribute 'date-run' - the date run 
    - node 'test-suite', attribute 'version' - the test suite version (for example 1.0.0 or 1.0.1)

4.  From this directory (test/update/Scripts), run

    cmake -P Submit_xquts.cmake > zorba-xquts-submission.xml

    Note that this assumes your build directory is ../../../build. If
    that is not true, specify the path to your build directory:

    cmake -D ZORBA_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/build -P Submit_xquts.cmake > zorba-xquts-submission.xml

    The script depends on the XQUTS schema being located in

    w3c_update_reportingresults/XQTSResult.xsd

    The XQUTS import script puts this in place appropriately. If you do
    not run the import script, just copy the "ReportingResults"
    directory from the XQUTS download to w3c_update_reportingresults.

In order to generate the HTML versions of the reports (XQUTSReport.html and XQUTSReportSimple.html) these are the additional steps that have to be followed:

5.  Go to the /tmp folder and unzip the XQUTS version you used to generate the report(s). Let's assume it is XQUTS_1_0_1.zip.

6.  Copy the XML(s) into the /tmp/XQUTS_1_0_1/ReportingResults folder

7.  Modify /tmp/XQUTS_1_0_1/ReportingResults/Results.xml by adding a result node for every report you copied at step 5.

8.  From /tmp/XQUTS_1_0_1/ReportingResults/ run 'ant -buildfile Build.xml' in order to generate XQUTSReport.html and XQUTSReportSimple.html
