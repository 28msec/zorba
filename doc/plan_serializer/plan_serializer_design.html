<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Zorba plan serialization
design document</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plan serializer is a part of Zorba
XQuery processor which handles the serialization of the xquery code
in compiled form. The purpose is to improve performance by
eliminating the need to compile the xquery code each time it is used.
Another benefit is being able to distribute proprietary xquery code
in a non-open source way.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serializing the compiled xquery means
actually serializing all the objects generated at compilation and
some other information needed by those objects, to be able to obtain
the same results at multiple executions given the same environment.
The main object structure to be serialized are the plan iterators
classes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The plan serializer is actually a C++
class serializer adjusted for Zorba particular needs. This class
serializer has been developed from scratch, being inspired at the
beginning from boost serialization.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main points the plan serializer
tries to solve are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serialization of data should be
	easy to understand and maintain by people not involved in developing
	the plan serializer. This is a critical point in ensuring the
	stability of the code. The serialization is done through simple
	instructions or macros, covering the general need and most of the
	corner cases. There is also a possibility to write complicated code,
	but keeping it simple is better.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serialization of data should be
	easy to check. Ensuring all the necessary data is serialized is a
	critical point. This check cannot be done automatically in C++, so
	it must be done in code review way. To satisfy this point, almost
	all the serialize() functions are defined in header files inside the
	classes, near the place where the class members are defined.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The serialization code should not
	interfere with existing code. Changing the existing code has been
	kept to minimum, most changes being adding missing member
	initialization in class constructors.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Platform independent: the
	serialized data  should be in a platform independent format. The
	xquery serialized on Windows 32 bits can be loaded onto Linux 64
	bits without problems.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each class has its own version
	history, independent of other classes. Every time the members of a
	class are modified, the serialize() function needs to be modified
	accordingly and the class version needs to be incremented. The new
	class can or cannot accept older versions, this depends on how the
	serialize() function is written and how the class version is
	specified.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The binary archive has its own
	version. This version increases when big changes are made in Zorba
	or plan serialization engine. Older versions are not accepted.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plan serialization should be fast
	both for out and in serialization. And it is fast.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When serializing, care should be
	taken when dealing with pointers to the same object. The Archiver
	maintains a hashmap with pointers to all the objects being
	serialized. Duplicate pointers are saved as reference only. There
	are some cases that have not been dealt with, like pointers pointing
	inside an array, but these can be workarounded.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Care should be taken with pointers
	to hardcoded objects. Zorba pre-initializes its own set of objects
	and those need not and cannot  be serialized. When loading a binary
	xquery, all the links to hardcoded objects need to be properly
	updated.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The operator &amp; is used for
serializing both in and out and the same for serialize() function.
You can check the direction of serialization by querying

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">How
serializing out works</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The operator &amp; is actually a
template implemented to serialize the SerializeBaseClass derived
classes. This operator will serialize the name of the class and then
call serialize() function for the parameter object, which will call
operator &amp; for each of its members and so on. This template
operator &amp; is defined in template_serializer.h .</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are also many operator &amp;
defined for simple types, you can see them in class_serializer.h/cpp
.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some Zorba classes need special
treatment during serialization, so they are serialized using special
operator &amp;, defined in files zorba_class_serializer.h/cpp.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The serialization is done into an
Archiver object. This object must be created for each serialization
process, so the serialization is thread safe. The out serialization
is done in two steps: first, all the data is serialized in a special
tree inside the Archiver object. Secondly, that tree is serialized
into a stream, in xml or binary format.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Archiver deals with all the
duplicate pointer issues, by maintaining a hashmap with pointers and
types of all serialized objects. It also deals with serializing
pointers to polymorphic classes,so the user doesn't have to register
them by hand like in boost serialization.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to ensure that all classes
have a serialize() function, some checks are done in debug mode for
the proper name of the class. This way, the serializer is sure to not
call the base class serialize() function by mistake.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">How
serializing in works</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each serializable class has a class
factory defined. This class factory is defined in the macro
SERIALIZABLE_CLASS(class_name) in the header file. There is a global
object for each class factory, so its constructor will be called at
program startup. This constructor registers this class factory and
associates it with the class name.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When serializing in, the Archiver reads
the class name from binary format and tells the corresponding class
factory to create the object. Then it calls the serialize() function
onto the newly created object and so on.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When loading objects on stack (not
pointers) the Archiver does not attempt to create the object and just
calls its serialize() function.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The objects must be loaded in the same
order they were saved. There is an attempt to serialize optional
fields, but this is not completed.</P>
