\section ft_thesaurus_intro Introduction

The Zorba XQuery engine implements the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-full-text-10/">XQuery and XPath Full Text 1.0</a>
specification that, among other things,
adds the ability to use a thesaurus for text-matching
via the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-full-text-10/#ftthesaurusoption">thesaurus option</a>.
For example, the query:

\code
let $x := <msg>affluent man</msg>
return $x contains text "wealthy"
  using thesaurus default
\endcode

returns \c true because \c $x contains "wealthy"
that the thesaurus identified as a synonym of "affluent".

The initial implementation of the thesaurus option uses the
<a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet lexical database</a>,
version 3.0.

The stock WordNet database files are plain ASCII text files.
In many ways this is very convenient
for portability, grep-ability, vi-ability, etc.
However, the sum total of the files is approximately 27MB
(which is quite large)
and accessing the database would be inefficient
since the files would have to be parsed for every access.

Instead, the database files are compiled into a single binary file
that is 6MB and can be efficiently accessed from Zorba
using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap">mmap(2)</a>
with no parsing of the data.
The only caveat of the binary format is that it is
<a ref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endian</a>-dependent,
i.e., a binary file created on a computer having a little-endian CPU
won't work on a computer having a big-endian CPU.

\section ft_thesaurus_download_install_wordnet Downloading & Installing the WordNet Database

To download and install the WordNet database on a Unix-like system,
follow these steps:

  -# Download the WordNet database from
     <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/download/">here</a>.
     All you really need are just the database files
     (<code>WNdb-3.0.tar.gz</code>).
  -# Un-gzip and untar the files.
     This will result in a directory dict containing the database files.
  -# Move the dict directory somewhere of your choosing,
     e.g., <code>/usr/local/wordnet-3.0/dict</code>.
  -# Compile the \c dict directory into a Zorba-compatible binary thesaurus
     as described below.

To compile the WordNet database files,
use the \c zt-wn-compile script
found in the \c scripts subdirectory of the Zorba distribution.
(Note: this script is written in perl.)
The usage message is:

\code
zt-wn-compile [-v] wordnet_dict_dir [thesaurus_file]
\endcode

  - The \c -v option specifies verbose output.
  - The \e wordnet_dict_dir specifies the full path
    of the WordNet \c dict directory.
  - The \e thesaurus_file specifies the name of the resulting binary file.
    If none is given, it defaults to \c wordnet-en.zth
    ("en" for English and "zth" for "Zorba Thesaurus file").

For example:

\code
zt-wn-compile -v /usr/local/wordnet-3.0/dict
\endcode

Move the \c wordnet-en.zth file to a location of your choosing.

\section ft_thesaurus_mappings Thesauri Mappings

In order to use thesauri,
you need to specify where they are to the Zorba engine
via one or more thesaurus \e mappings.
A \e mapping maps a symbolic URI to URI for an actual thesaurus.
A mapping is of the form:

<i>from_uri</i><code>:=</code><b>[</b><i>implementation</i><code>|</code><b>]</b></i>to_uri</i>

For example:

\code
http://wordnet.princeton.edu:=wordnet|/usr/local/zorba/thesauri/wordnet-en.zth
\endcode

says that the symbolic URI \c http://wordnet.princeton.edu
maps to the WordNet implementation
having a database file at the given path.
Once a mapping is established for a symbolic URI,
it can be used in a query:

\code
let $x := <msg>affluent man</msg>
return $x contains text "wealthy"
  using thesaurus at "http://wordnet.princeton.edu"
\endcode

If the \e implementation is omitted,
it defaults to \c wordnet.
As a special-case,
the \e from_uri can be \c default or \c ##default
to allow for specifying the default thesaurus
as was done for the first example on this page.

\section ft_thesaurus_mappings_to_zorba Specifying Thesauri Mappings to Zorba

To specify the location of the thesaurus to Zorba from the command-line,
use one or more â€“thesaurus options:

\code
zorba --thesaurus default:=/usr/local/zorba/thesauri/wordnet-en.zth ...
\endcode

\section ft_thesaurus_relationships Thesaurus Relationships

Using the WordNet database,
Zorba supports all of the thesaurus relationships
specified by [ISO 2788]
and [ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005]
with the exceptions of "HN" (history note)
and "X SN" (see scope note for).

\subsection ft_thesaurus_iso_rels ISO 2788 and ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 Relationships

These relationships are:

<center>
  <table class="fulltext_relationships">
    <tr>
      <th>Rel.</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
      <th>WordNet Rel.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BT</td>
      <td>broader term</td>
      <td>hypernym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>broader term generic</td>
      <td>hypernym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BTI</td>
      <td>broader term instance</td>
      <td>instance hypernym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BTP</td>
      <td>broader term partitive</td>
      <td>part meronym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NT</td>
      <td>narrower term</td>
      <td>hyponym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NTG</td>
      <td>narrower term generic</td>
      <td>hyponym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NTI</td>
      <td>narrower term instance</td>
      <td>instance hyponym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NTP</td>
      <td>narrower term partitive</td>
      <td>part holonym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>RT</td>
      <td>related term</td>
      <td>also see</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SN</td>
      <td>scope note</td>
      <td>n/a</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>TT</td>
      <td>top term</td>
      <td>hypernym</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>non-preferred term</td>
      <td>n/a</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>USE</td>
      <td>preferred term</td>
      <td>n/a</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>

and can be used in a query like:

\code
let $x := <msg>breakfast of champions</msg>
return $x contains text "meal"
  using thesaurus at "http://wordnet.princeton.edu"
  relationship "NT"
\endcode

that returns \c true because \c $x contains "breakfast"
that the thesaurus identified as a "narrower term" (NT)
of "meal."

Note that you can specify relationships
either by their abbreviation
or their meaning.
Relationships are case-insensitive.
The above query is equivalent to:

\code
let $x := <msg>breakfast of champions</msg>
return $x contains text "meal"
  using thesaurus at "http://wordnet.princeton.edu"
  relationship "narrower term"
\endcode

Since Zorba's thesaurus is implemented using WordNet,
the [ISO 2788] relationships map to WordNet relationships
that are shown in the "WordNet Rel." column.
WordNet relationships are explained in the next section.
