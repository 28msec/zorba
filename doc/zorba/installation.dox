\subsection SourceInstallation Installing the Source Distribution

 The Zorba source is available as tar.gz and zip file. The Zorba sources can be installed by extracting the compressed files 
 (e.g. tar xvfz zorba-{version}.tar.gz).  This creates a zorba-{version} directory in you current working directory.

 For building Zorba, please follow the build instructions (see \ref build). 

\subsection BinaryInstallation Installing the Binary Distribution

 Once you have successfully build Zorba using the "Unix Makefile" generator (see \ref SourceInstallation),
 you can execute <tt>make install</tt> from within the build directory to install Zorba. This will install Zorba
 into the path specified by the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable. 

 Note that for setting the install prefix, you can use the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable.
 For example, in order to install Zorba in <tt>/opt</tt> use <tt>cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt &lt;zorba source directory&gt; </tt>.

 However, CMake generated makefiles also support
 the make DESTDIR variable (see <a href="http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#Does_CMake.27s_.22make_install.22_support_DESTDIR.3F" target="_blank">CMAKE FAQ</a>).
 There is also a <tt>make uninstall</tt> command available (also to be called from the build directory).

 Alternatively, you can use one of Zorba's binary distributions if it is available for your platform.
 For example, download and decompress the tar-ball for Mac OS X (e.g. zorba-{version}-Darwin-i386.tar.gz).

 For both installations, you will need to add Zorba's bin directory (e.g. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin or 
 zorba-0.9.2541-Darwin-i386/bin) to your PATH environment variable. 

 Additionally, you will need to add the according library search path (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux,
 DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac, and PATH on Windows) to point to the lib directory (e.g. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib or
 zorba-{version}-Darwin-i386/lib). Also, please make sure that the directories of the required libraries (see \ref build) are
 present in your library search path.
  
 After that, try typing <tt>%zorba -q '1+1'</tt> and you should see 
 \code
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   2
 \endcode

  as a result. Congratulations - you're done and ready to use Zorba. Otherwise, please
  consult the zorba-users mailing list for help.

  For programming against the Zorba library, we refer to the API examples provided with
  the source and binary distribution (see \link simple.cpp \endlink for an example).

  In order to make the installation process easier, we also provide graphical installers for 
  Windows and Mac OS X.
