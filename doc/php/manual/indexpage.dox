/*! \mainpage PHP API Documentation

  Zorba ships with a PHP language binding that provides some basic features in order to prepare and execute queries
  with Zorba.
  
  The <a href="http://www.zorba-xquery.com/html/entry/2011/12/27/PHP_Meets_XQuery">following tutorial</a> provides an overview on how to leverage Zorba into PHP applications. 
  We also provide the following <a class="en" href="examples.html">set of examples</a> that show how the Zorba PHP API can be used.

  \section note Note for non-C++ language bindings
  Zorba's current API documentation is generated from the C++ source. The PHP language API is derived directly from this. The information contained in this documentation is accurate for PHP, although it will look somewhat odd.

  \example test.php
   This is a simple example that demonstrate how to use the Zorba XQuery Engine to
   create, compile, and execute queries.
