  Specification for creating a value or general index.

  theNumKeyColumns: 
  -----------------
  The number of columns in each key.

  theKeyTypes:
  ------------
  The data types of the key columns. Each type must be a builtin atomic type,
  and for sorted indices, it must have an ordering.

  theCollations: 
  --------------
  The names (uris) of the collations to use when comparing the string columns 
  of two keys. The size of this vector is equal to theNumKeyColumns; if a type
  of a key column is not string, the associated entry in theCollations is the 
  empty string.

  theTimezone:
  ------------
  The timezone is needed to compare date/time key values.

  theIsGeneral:
  -------------
  Whether the index is "general" or not.

  theIsUnique: 
  ------------
  Whether the index is unique, i.e., there is exactly one value associated with
  each key.

  theIsSorted:
  ------------
  Whether the index is sorted by its key values or not.

  theIsTemp:
  ----------
  Whether the index is temporary or not.

  theIsThreadSafe:
  ----------------
  Whether the index can be shared among multiple threads or not.

  theIsAutomatic:
  ---------------
  Whether the index must be maintained during/after each apply- updates or not.

  theSources:
  -----------
  The qnames of the collections accessed by the defining exprs of this index.

  Class IndexCondition represents a search condition on the keys of an index.
  An instance of IndexCondition is given as a parameter to the init() method
  of an IndexProbeIterator (see iterator.h), which can then iterate over the
  items in the value of each index key that satisfies the condition.

  There are 4 kinds of index conditions:

  POINT_VALUE :
  -------------

  It represents a condition that is satisfied by at most one index key tuple,
  namely the index key tuple K (if it exists) that is equal, according to the
  rules of value equality, to a user specified search key tuple. If any of
  the domain items associated with K is also associated with another key tuples,
  an error os raised.

  POINT_GENERAL:
  --------------

  It represents a condition that is satisfied by all index keys that are equal,
  according to the rules of general equality, to a user specified search key.
  This condition is applicable to general indexes only.


  BOX_VALUE :
  -----------

  It represents a condition that is satisfied by the index keys inside a
  user-specified "box".

  Let M be the number of key columns. Then, an M-dimensional box is defined as
  a conjuction of M range conditions on columns 0 to M-1. Each range condition
  specifies a range of acceptable values for some key column. Specifically, a
  range is defined as the set of all key values K such that

  lower_bound <? K <? upper_bound, where <? is either the lt or the le operator.

  The lower bound may be -INFINITY and the upper bound may be +INFINTY.

  BOX_GENERAL :
  -------------

  It represents the following condition:

  bound op? K, where 

  (a) op? is one of <, <=, >, or >=, 
  (b) K is a key value, and 
  (c) bound is either an atomic item or -INFINITY or +INFINITY.

/**************************************************************************//**

  Abstract index class. It represents both "value" and "general" indexes.

  Value Indexes:
  --------------

  From the store's point of view, a "value index" is a container that "stores"
  a relation between tuples of atomic items (called key tuples) and items
  (called domain items). The relationship is a function on the domain items,
  i.e., for each domain item there is exactly one key tuple. In general, the
  function is N:1, that is, several domain items may have the same key tuple.

  The key tuples must satisfy the following constraints:

  1. All key tuples in a value index have the same fixed number of items, say M.
     Given this constraint, we can define the i-th "key column" of a value index
     as the set of items that appear in the i-th position of each key tuple. If
     an index has N tuples, then there are M key columns, each containing N items.

  2. The items in each key column must be comparable with each other using the
     Item::equals() method and/or the Item::compare() method. This implies that
     all items in a key column must belong to the same branch of the XMLSchema
     type hierarchy. Furthermore, no key item may have type xs:untypedAtomic or
     xs:anyAtomicType.

  General Indexes:
  ----------------

  From the store's point of view, a "general index" is a container that "stores"
  a relation between tuples of atomic items (called key tuples) and items
  (called domain items). The relationship is N:M, that is, each domain item
  may have more than one associated key tuples and several domain items may
  be associated with the same key tuple.

  Let D be a domain item and K an associated key tuple. In the case of value
  indexes, if K contains a key item whose type is xs:untypedAtomic, an error
  is raised. In contrast, a general index casts the xs:untyped key item to
  every other primitive xml-schema type and for each such successful cast,
  creates a new key tuple by replacing the xs:untypedAtomic item with the
  result of the cast. D is then associated with each of these new tuples. The
  process is repeated until there are no xs:untypedAtomic key items in any
  of the key tuples. Finally, the associations between D and the transformed
  key tuples are stored in the index container.

  After the above transformations, the key tuples must satisfy the same
  constraints as the key tuples of value indexes.


  It is expected that for both value and general indexes, the index container
  is organized in a way that makes it efficient to find all the domain items
  whose associated key tuple(s) satisfy a given search condition (see class
  IndexCondition below).
