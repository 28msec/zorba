Zorba - The XQuery Processor
version 1.0 (coming)
  * Changes in the C++ API
    * Added a new called named ExternalModule.
      This class must be used for registering external functions.
      This change makes the external function API incompatible with
      previous releases
    * Loading pre-compiled queries requires to pass
      a SerializationCallback which is used for
      retrieving registered uri resolvers or trace streams.
      Moreover, the callback is used for retrieving ExternalModules
      which have been used when compiling the query.
  * Resolving of modules is now enhanced by the so called "Zorba Module Path".
    Moreover, multiple ModuleURIResolvers can be registered in one StaticContext.
    See the documentation for more information.
  * Added the excel library to the built-in modules
  * Added the math library to the built-in modules (the namespace has changed to 
    Http://www.zorba-xquery.com/modules/math)
  * Pass the Static- and DynamicContext as parameter to the evaluate function
    of external functions.
  * The XQuery class got a setTimeout option that allows the user to set a 
    maximum running time of a particular query execution.
  * The StatelessExternalFunction is now non-pure by default. There is a
    new subclass called PureStatelessExternalFunction which should be used instead.
    PureStatelessExternalFunctions don't have access to the Static- and DynamicContext.

version 0.9.8-rev1 (2009.09.22)
  * bug fixes
    * fixed a crash caused by converting long integers (> 1024 digits) to string
    * the compile-only check reports the URI of the encapsulating entity in it's error report (used for XQDT semantic checking)
    * fixed 'for $x in () return $x/test' to return the empty sequence instead of raising a static error
    * fixed build using Xerces-C 3.0.1
    * fixed build for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
    * improved error reporting in the command line utility
    * improved detection of the installed version of Xerces-C (raise an error if a wrong version is installed)

version 0.9.8 (2009.08.26)
  * More XQuery Scripting Features
		* default initialization for external variables
		* block local variables
  * XQuery 1.1
		* Support for the "validation as TypeName" feature
		* changed the try/catch syntax as specified in XQuery 1.1 (except the try- and catch expressions are ExprSingle and not Expr).
	* Examples for the Java API
	* Function library
  	* creating PDFs using XSL Formatting Objects (requires Java)
		* util:parse function
  	* converter functions to/from JSON or JsonML and XML
  	* function for sending simple text emails
  	* the util:tidy function returns a node instead of a string.
  	* XQDoc module http://www.zorba-xquery.com/zorba/xqdoc-functions
	* Added a loadProlog function to the static context.
  * Added support for XQueryX and XQueryX Update
	* Added compiled query persistence to the C++ API (XQuery::loadExecutionPlan() and XQuery::saveExecutionPlan())
  * Added a printPlan function to the XQuery class of the API.
  * Added new option in the Zorba command line utility: compile-only, parse-only, lib-module, print-errors-as-xml.
  * Added two plan printing function (printPlanAsXML and printPlanAsDOT) to the SWIG generated APIs.
  * Implemented 'declare option': options are set in the static context.
  * fn:trace can be disabled by setting the option QName("http://www.zorba-xquery.org/option", "trace")  to "disable".
  * Changed the scripting syntax of the exit expression from 'exit with' to 'exit returning'.
  	This is due to an ambiguity in the grammar (see http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6852 for more information).
  * Added accessor functions for node items to the Item class in the API (i.e. getChildren, getAttributes, and getNodeName).
  * Added a UserException to the API which is raised if the user makes a call to the fn:error function.
	* UTF8 support for the lexer
	* bug fixes and performance improvements

version 0.9.5 (2008.02.17)
  * Unified the Tidy and Rest API's
  * Added new sinatures to zorba-util:tidy and zorba-util:tdoc that
	allow setting of tidy functions
  * Added Schema imports using target namespace or location hints
  * Added StaticContext::findFunctions and StaticContext::disableFunciton
  * Added Functions for collections 
  * Windows packages include a zorba_simplestore.dll
  * Improved error messages for regular expression processing
  * Added functions to return an item instead of xs:string
  * Added a new signature to zorba-util:random in order to be able to call
	random within a loop and get different numbers each time.
  * Corrected the types of some functions/operators (YM_DURATION or 
	DT_DURATION instead of DURATION).
  * Now possible to pass empty sequence as collection URI.
  * Now cURL is set to follow an infinite number of redirects.
  * Added validate after update
  * Fixed schema files without target namespace.
  * Fixed notation cast.
  * Added list and union item types to type manager cache
  * Added validation tests for schema substitution groups
  * Added message when error during update test driver.
  * Added partial support for scripting (XQSE)

	declarations.
  * Various bug fixes and performance enhancements.
