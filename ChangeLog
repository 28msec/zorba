Zorba - The XQuery Processor

version 3.1

New Features:
  * Add query profiling feature.
  * The json-xml module now supports the "object form" of JsonML.
  * Fixed bugs in the json-xml module.
  * Added public introspection API for external variable annotations.
  * Added non deterministic functions to the JDBC module.
  * Added introspection API for external variable annotations.
  * setVariable() now supports casting sequence elements.
  * zorba command now supports converting multiple values for the same variable into a sequence, e.g.: zorba -e x:=1 -e x:=2 -q 'declare variable $x as xs:integer+ external; $x'
  * The function caching mechanism of Zorba has been completely revamped. New annotations have been introduced for function caching.
    - `%an:nondeterministic`: Declares that the function is non-deterministic. Several calls with the same paramaters may
      return different results. The optimizer is not allowed to cache anything.
    - `%an:deterministic` (default): Declares that the function is deterministic. Several calls with the same paramaters always
      return the same results in the same snapshot, except that newly constructed nodes will have a different identity on each
      call. This is the default behavior from the W3C specifications.
    - `%an:strictlydeterministic`: Declares and enforces that a function is deterministic. Several calls with the same paramaters always
      return the exact same results (also same identity) within a snapshot. The optimizer guarantees this by caching within a snapshot.
    - For a function that only has atomics in its signature, `%an:strictlydeterministic` and `%an:deterministic` are semantically
      equivalent. These functions are by default automatically cached by the optimizer.
    - `%an:cache` (use with care): forces caching across snapshots.
    - `%an:exclude-from-cache-key(n)` specifies that a function argument has to be ignored when computing the cache key.
    - `%an:compare-with-deep-equal(n)` specifies that a function argument has to be compared with deep-equal semantics.
  * New sleep module.
  * Substancial improvements to the http client module.
  * Added JSON Data Manager to expose json parsing through the C++ api.
  * Iterator tree printing as XML or JSON.

version 3.0

New Naming:
  * All modules, annotations, options, collations, pragmas, and other
    namespace URIs changed from http://www.zorba-xquery.com/
    to http://zorba.io/ .

New Features:
  * The grouping variable in a group by clause is now optional.
  * JSONiq extension: New syntax for JSONiq array lookup: expr1[[expr2]].
  * JSONiq extension: jn:trim() and libjn:descendant-arrays().
  * JSONiq extension: Object/array navigation allows item()* as the type of the
    input sequence (doing implicit iteration over the input sequence and skipping
    items that are not objects/arrays).
  * JSONiq extension: Several of the jsoniq functions now allow item()* as the
    type of the input sequence (doing implicit iteration over the input sequence
    and skipping or simply propagating items that are not objects/arrays).
  * JSONiq extension: implicit iteration is also done for jsoniq delete, renames,
    and value replacements.
  * JSONiq extension: EBV on jsoniq items now returns true (instead of raising
    an error).
  * JSONiq extension: jn:analyze-string and jn:serializeFixed (#1192246).

New Features:
  * A new common-language mode has been added to help write code that is 
    compatible with both Zorba's extended XQuery and JSONiq languages. It will 
    raise warnings for code that is not conformant to the common subset.
  * Typeswitch expression extended to allow union of types in each case clause,
    as specified by XQuery v3.0
  * In C++ API, added optional XML formatting of exceptions.

    of a catch clause.

    to estimate the size an item allocates in memory.
  * Extended sequence types to include unions, as specified by XQuery v3.0
  * Added XQuery::parse(std::istream& aQuery, ModuleInfo_t& aResult) function.

    for streamable strings and base64Binary.

    function invocation, and related fn library functions).

Optimizations:
  * Extended optimization rules for subsequence function (pushing $startingLoc
    parameter into collection skip if $sourceSeq parameter is from a
    collection).
  * Introduced generic framework for optimizing fn:count() during runtime:
    Virtual PlanIterator::count() method provides the base (unoptimized)
    implementation of fn:count(). This base method is redefined by other plan
    iterators who have a way of returning the cardinality of their result
    sequence without actually computing the full result sequence.

version 1.0
  * Changes in the C++ API
    * Removed ResultIterator class. All public API methods use simply
      Iterator.
    * Added a new class named ExternalModule.
      This class must be used for registering external functions.
      This change makes the external function API incompatible with
      previous releases.
    * Loading pre-compiled queries (using loadExecutionPlan) requires to pass
      a SerializationCallback which is used for
      retrieving registered uri resolvers or trace streams.
      Moreover, the callback is used for retrieving ExternalModules
      which have been used when compiling the query.
    * Changed the append function in zorba::String to const. Now, the
      function does not change the String itself, but returns a new
      String. Furgthermore zorba::String::append can now handle other
      zorba::String objects - not only const char*. Also the operators
      + and += are defined on zorba::String.
  * Other language bindings (Java, PHP, python, ruby) also now use
    simply Iterator; ResultIterator removed.
  * XQC (C language binding) brought up-to-date with latest revision
    of that spec (https://xqc.sourceforge.net).
  * Resolving of modules is now enhanced by the so called "Zorba
    Module Path".  Moreover, multiple ModuleURIResolvers can be
    registered in one StaticContext.  See the documentation for more
    information.
  * Added static and dynamic context introspection modules.
  * Added the excel library to the built-in modules.
    Implemented the most used excel functions.
  * Added the math library to the built-in modules (the namespace has
    changed to http://www.zorba-xquery.com/modules/math)
  * Pass the Static- and DynamicContext as parameter to the evaluate function
    of external functions.
  * The XQuery class got a setTimeout option that allows the user to set a
    maximum running time of a particular query execution.
  * The StatelessExternalFunction is now non-pure by default. There is
    a new subclass called PureStatelessExternalFunction which should
    be used instead. PureStatelessExternalFunctions don't have access
    to the Static- and DynamicContext.
  * Renamed XQuery::serialize to XQuery::execute. The new method also
    implements the functionality of the XQuery::applyUpdates method
    (which was removed).
  * Added the serialize library to the built-in modules. The function
    util:serialize-to-string has been removed.
  * The DynamicContext can be used to pass arbitrary name-value pairs
    to the evaluate method of external functions.
  * Implemented CSV to XML converters. See csv2xml.xq module.
    You can convert back and forth between CSV files and XML
    or formated text files and XML.
  * Changes in the email functionnality
    * implemented smtp:send functions as external functions
    * added support for MIME messages (Text in character sets other
      than ASCII, Non-text attachments, Message bodies with multiple
      parts, Header information in non-ASCII character sets)
  * most of the runtime iterators and functions are generated
    (see https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/zorba/index.php?title=Creating_New_Runtime_Iterators_and_Functions)
  * improved exception messages raised by the serializer
  * Json is now able to parse Unicode messages
  * improved functionality for java, php, python and ruby bindings.

    * fixed a crash caused by converting long integers (> 1024 digits)
      to string

      instead of raising a static error
    * fixed build using Xerces-C 3.0.1
    * fixed build for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

    parse-only, lib-module, print-errors-as-xml.
  * Added two plan printing function (printPlanAsXML and
    printPlanAsDOT) to the SWIG generated APIs.
  * Implemented 'declare option': options are set in the static context.
  * fn:trace can be disabled by setting the option
    QName("http://www.zorba-xquery.org/option", "trace") to "disable".
  * Changed the scripting syntax of the exit expression from 'exit
    with' to 'exit returning'.This is due to an ambiguity in the
    grammar (see http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6852
    for more information).
  * Added accessor functions for node items to the Item class in the
    API (i.e. getChildren, getAttributes, and getNodeName).
