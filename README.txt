  FLWOR Foundation - Zorba 0.9
  ----------------------------

  Welcome to Zorba! We are pleased to announce the first release (beta version 0.9) of the Zorba. 
  Zorba is a general purpose XQuery processor implementing in C++ the W3C family of specifications. 
  It is not an XML database. The query processor has been designed to be embeddable in a variety of 
  environments such as other programming languages extended with XML processing capabilities, 
  browsers, database servers, XML message dispatchers, or smartphones. Its architecture employes a 
  modular design, which allows customizing the Zorba query processor to the environmentâ€™s needs. 
  In particular the architecture of the query processor allows a pluggable XML store 
  (e.g. main memory, DOM stores, persistent disk-based large stores, S3 stores).
  Zorba runs on most platforms and is available under the Apache license v2.

  In this first release of Zorba, the following functionalities are implemented:
  
   * XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 (as in the W3C recommendation) except modules and only limited support for schema validation
   * XQuery Update Facility 1.0 (as in the evolving W3C recommendation)
   * An in-memory replaceable XML store implementing the XQuery Data Model (XDM) W3C recommendation.

  Zorba release 0.9 passes 97.6% of the W3C tests of XQuery 1.0 test suite
  and 99.4% of the XQuery Update Facility test suite. 
  However, this release is not optimized for performance (e.g indexes are not supported yet).
