 * To compile and execute an XQuery, an instance of this class must be created. 
 * This is done by using either the createQuery or compileQuery methods of the
 * Zorba class. These methods return an instance of XQuery_t, which is a 
 * reference counted smart pointer to a dynamically allocated XQuery object.
 * After receiving an XQuery_t, an application can make multiple copies of it.
 * Hence, an XQuery object can have multiple users, potentially in different
 * threads. The XQuery object is deleted when all XQuery_t objects that point 
 * to it are destroyed.
 *
 * The file \link simple.cpp \endlink contains some basic examples the demonstrate
 * the use of this class.
 *
 * Note: This class is reference counted. When writing multi-threaded clients,
 * it is the responibility of the client code to synchronize assignments to the
 * SmartPtr holding this object.
