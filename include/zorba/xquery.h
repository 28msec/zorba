  /** \brief This class is the representation of an %XQuery in the %Zorba engine.
   *
   * To compile and execute an XQuery, an instance of this class must be created. 
   * This is done by using either the createQuery or compileQuery methods of the
   * Zorba class. These methods return an instance of XQuery_t, which is a 
   * reference counted smart pointer to a dynamically allocated XQuery object. After receiving
   * an XQuery_t, an application can make multiple copies of it.
   * Hence, each XQuery object can have multiple owners, potentially in different
   * threads. The XQuery object is deleted when all XQuery_t objects that point 
   * to it are destroyed.
   *
   * Although an XQuery instance may be accessible from multiple threads, the
   * instance is not thread safe, i.e.\ its methods should not be invoked in 
   * parallel by multiple threads. The only exception to this rule is the clone()
   * method. Cloning is the way to execute the same query from multiple threads.
   * Cloning can be done only after the query has been compiled. The clone() 
   * method creates and returns a new XQuery object that shares the same 
   * execution plan as the original XQuery object. After clone() returns, the
   * calling thread can invoke the various execution methods on the XQuery clone. 
   *
   * The file \link simple.cpp \endlink contains some basic examples the demonstrate
   * the use of this class.
   *
   * Note: This class is reference counted. When writing multi-threaded clients,
   * it is the responibility of the client code to synchronize assignments to the
   * SmartPtr holding this object.
