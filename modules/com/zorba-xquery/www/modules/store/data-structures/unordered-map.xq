 : <p>This module defines a set of functions for working with maps. A map
 : is identified by a QName and can be created using the map:create or
 : map:create-transient functions and deleted using the map:delete function,
 : respectively.</p>
 :
 : <p>The lifetime of a transient map is limited by the execution of the 
 : current XQuery program. A non-transient (or persistent) map lives until 
 : it is explicitly deleted. Accordingly, it's also available
 : to other XQuery programs.</p>
 :
 : <p>The key of a particular entry in the map can consist of a tuple of
 : atomic values (called attributes). The actual type of each attribute
 : is determined when the map is created. The value of each attribute can
 : be an arbitrary sequence of items.</p>
