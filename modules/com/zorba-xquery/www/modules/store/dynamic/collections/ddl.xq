 : This modules defines a set of functions for managing persistent, ordered, and
 : updatable collections.
 :
 : Such collections are identified by QNames and come into existence (i.e. be made
 : available) by calling one of the two create-collection functions and be destroyed by
 : the delete-collection function.
 :
 : In contrast to the functions in the module 
 : <tt>http://www.zorba-xquery.com/modules/store/static/collections/ddl</tt>
 : the function in this module operate on collections which do not have to
 : be statically declared in the prolog of a module.
