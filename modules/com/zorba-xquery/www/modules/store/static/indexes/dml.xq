 : To describe the semantics of this function, we start by defining the i-th 
 : key column of an index as the set of key items produced by evaluating the 
 : i-th keyspec of the index for every domain node. Then, the search condition 
 : of a range probe can be defined as a number of rangespecs, where a 
 : rangespec describes a constraint on the values of a key column. The first 
 : rangespec applies to the first key column, the second rangespec to the 
 : second key column, etc. The number of rangespecs must be less or equal to 
 : the number of keyspecs found in the declaration of the given index. 
 : Each rangespec consists of 6 values:
 :
 :   * rangeLowerBound : The lower bound in a range of key values.
 :   * rangeUpperBound : The upper bound in a range of key values.
 :   * rangeHaveLowerBound : If false, then there is no lower bound, or 
 :     equivalently, the lower bound is -INFINITY (the actual rangeLowerBound 
 :     value is ignored). Otherwise, the lower bound is the one given by the 
 :     rangeLowerBound value. The effective lower bound of the range is either 
 :     the rangeLowerBound if rangeHaveLowerBound is true, or -INFINITY if 
 :     rangeHaveLowerBound is false.
 :   * rangeHaveUpperBound : If false, then there is no upper bound, or 
 :     equivalently, the upper bound is +INFINITY (the actual rangeUpperBound 
 :     value is ignored). Otherwise, the upper bound is the one given by the 
 :     rangeUpperBound value. The effective upper bound of the range is either
 :     the rangeUpperBound if rangeHaveUpperBound is true, or +INFINITY if 
 :     rangeHaveUpperBound is false.
 :   * rangeLowerBoundIncluded : If false, then the range is open from below,
 :     i.e., the rangeLowerBound value is not considered part of the range. 
 :     Otherwise, the range is closed from below, i.e., the rangeLowerBound 
 :     value is part of the range.
 :   * rangeUpperBoundIncluded : If false, then the range is open from above,
 :     i.e., the rangeUpperBound value is not considered part of the range. 
 :     Otherwise, the range is closed from above, i.e., the rangeUpperBound 
 :     value is part of the range.

 : @param $name The QName of the index.
 : @param $rangeLowerBound1 The lower bound in a range of key values.
 : @param $rangeUpperBound1 The upper bound in a range of key values.
 : @param $rangeHaveLowerBound If false, then there is no lower bound, or 
 :          equivalently, the lower bound is -INFINITY. Otherwise, the lower 
 :          bound is the one given by the rangeLowerBound value. 
 : @param $rangeHaveUpperBound If false, then there is no upper bound, or 
 :          equivalently, the upper bound is +INFINITY. Otherwise, the upper 
 :          bound is the one given by the rangeUpperBound value.
