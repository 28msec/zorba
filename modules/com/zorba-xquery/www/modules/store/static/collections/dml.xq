 : This modules provides a set of functions to modify a collection and retrieve the nodes
 : contained in a particular collection.
 :
 : Collections are identified by QNames and come into existence (i.e. be made available)
 : by calling one of the two create-collection functions of the 
 : <tt>http://www.zorba-xquery.com/modules/store/static/collections/ddl</tt>
 : module.
 :
 : The variable $content passed to any of the insert functions is evaluated
 : as though it were an enclosed expression in an element constructor.
 : The result of this step is a sequence of nodes to be inserted into the collection.
