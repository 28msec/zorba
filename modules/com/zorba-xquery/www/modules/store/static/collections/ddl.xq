 : This modules defines a set of functions for managing persistent, ordered, and
 : updatable collections which are declared in the prolog (context) of a module.
 : For example, it provides functions to create, delete, or introspect collections.
 :
 : Such collections are identified by QNames and come into existence (i.e. be made
 : available) by calling one of the two create-collection functions and be destroyed by
 : the delete-collection function.
