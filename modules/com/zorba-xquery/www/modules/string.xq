 : This function materializes a streamable string.
 : The drawback of a streamable string is that its value can only
 : be consumed once. That is, only one function can access the value
 : of a streamable string item.
 :
 : In order to remedy this situation, this function can be used to 
 : convert a streamable string into its non-streamable counterpart. As a
 : result, the string returned by this function has the same value as its
 : input but is materialized and, hence, can be consumed multiple times.
 :
 : @param $s the streamable string item to materialize
 : @return a materialized string of its input or the input if the input
 :         item was not a streamable string.

 : This function checks whether a given string item is implemented by a
 : streamable string.
 : A streamable string is produced by some functions of a module
 : (e.g. file:read-text()). It's an optimized implementation of an
 : xs:string to handle arbitrary sized data. The drawback is that
 : its value can only be consumed once. That is, only one function
 : can access the value of a streamable string item.
 :
 : @param $s the string to check
 : @return true if the given item is implemented using a streamable string
 :         or false otherwise.
