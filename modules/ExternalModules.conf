# Configuration file for defining where external modules supported by
# the Zorba Team may be downloaded from source control.

# Format:
#   short-mod-name   vc-type   url   [ tag ]
#
# where:
#   "short-mod-name" is a convenient name for identifying the module
#   "vc-type" is the type of version control software (so far
#       only "bzr" and "svn" are supported)
#   "url" is the URL to check out
#   "tag" is the VCS tag to check out (optional - defaults to HEAD;
#       currently only works for bzr, since svn tags are just different URLS)
