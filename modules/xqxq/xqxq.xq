 : 
 : Important notes regarding the second and third parameters of the function:
 : --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 :
 : These parameters allow you to specify a URL resolver and a URI mapper
 : for Zorba to use when executing this query. See
 : http://www.zorba-xquery.com/html/documentation/2.7.0/zorba/uriresolvers
 :
 : The second parameter is a function item for a URL
 : resolver. The URL resolver function must recive 2 parameters:
 :   A $namespace as xs:string that will contain the url to be resolved.
 :   A $entity as xs:string that will contain the type of resolving needed;
 :   this can be 2 values "module" and "schema".
 : The function must return an empty sequence when the specified $namespace
 : or $entity are not the ones to be resolved.
 :
 : Example:
 :   
 : declare function mymod:url-resolver($namespace as xs:string, $entity as xs:string)
 : {
 :  if($namespace = 'http://test.xq')
 :  then "module namespace test = 'http://test'; declare function test:foo(){'foo'};"
 :  else ()
 : };
 :
 : The URL resolver function's namespace, name, and parameter naming are
 : not restricted by XQXQ.
 :
 : The URL resolver function's return type is not restricted, it could be a string, a sequence,
 : a node, etc. All the outputs types are to be serialized as a string.
 :
 : The third parameter is a function item for a URI mapper.
 : The URI mapper function, just like the URL resolver, receives 2 parameters:
 :   A $namespace as xs:string that will contain the URI to be mapped.
 :   A $entity as xs:string that will contain the type of resolving needed;
 :   this can be 2 values "module" and "schema".
 : The URI mapper must return an empty sequence when the specified $namesapce or $entity
 : are not to be mapped. Unlike the URL resolver this function must return a sequence of strings.
 :
 : Example:
 :
 : declare function mymod:uri-mapper($namespace as xs:string, $entity as xs:string)
 : {
 :  if($namespace = 'http://test')
 :  then ("http://www.zorba-xquery.com/test", "http://foo.com/schema/test")
 :  else ()
 : };
 :
 : The URI mapper function's namespace, name, and parameter naming are
 : not restricted by XQXQ.
 :
 : In order to pass the above URL resolver and URI mapper to this function,
 : use the following syntax:
 :
 :   variable $queryID := xqxq:prepare-main-module("..query text..",
 :      mymod:url-resolver#2, mymod:uri-mapper#2);
 :
 : That is, the QName of the function followed by "#2". This is XQuery
 : "higher-order function" syntax, meaning the function with the specified
 : QName which takes two arguments. Since URL resolvers and URI mappers
 : must take two arguments, both will always be specified with "#2".
 :
 : Note that parameters 2 and 3 should be declared as follows:
 :    as function($url as xs:string, $entity as xs:string) as item()
 :    as function($uri as xs:string, $entity as xs:string) as xs:string*
 : However Zorba's implementation of higher-order functions (HOF) is not
 : yet complete enough to allow for this. When Zorba's HOF implementation
 : is complete this function signature will be changed.
 :
 : Both the URL resolver and URI mapper functions are optional, meaning you
 : may pass the empty-sequence () for either.
 :
 : Successfully prepared queries need to be deleted by passing the resulting
 : identifier to the xqxq:delete-query function of this module.
 :
 : @param $main-module-text the XQuery program that should be prepared.
 :   The program needs to be a XQuery main module.
 :
 : @param $resolver the URL resolver function.
 : 
 : @param $mapper the URI mapper function.
 :
 : @return an identifier for the compiled program that can be passed
 :   as arguments to other functions of this module.
 :
 : @error any (static or type) error that may be raised during the compilation
 : of the query. For example, err:XPST0003 if the given XQuery program could
 : not be parsed.
