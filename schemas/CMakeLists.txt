# only ever load them when an imported schema file references them
# (which, in turn, only happens in error cases - see bug 921624). So,
# we install them as schemas. Yes, this means they'll have an ".schema"
# extension in the uri directory, but that's OK because Zorba will
# look for them with that extension.
