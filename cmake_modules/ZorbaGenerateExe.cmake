# This macro helps creating executables that are store dependent (e.g. one zorbacmd version must be 
# compiled and linked for each registered store). This macro takes the CMake variable 
# ZORBA_STORE_NAME and creates one executable with this name.
# Per convention, the source file that contains the main function of the executable must be located in 
# the directory where this macro is executabed and must the following name: '${EXE_NAME}.cpp'. 
# If the cmake variable ZORBA_BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY is set to "ON", the macro produces additinally a 
# static executable.
#
# The resulting executable has the name ${EXE_NAME}_${ZORBA_STORE_NAME} or 
# ${EXE_NAME}_${ZORBA_STORE_NAME}_static if the store name is not equal "simplestore". Otherwise, 
# the name is ${EXE_NAME} or ${EXE_NAME}_static.
#
# Synatx:
# 
#   ZORBA_GENERATE_EXE(EXE_NAME DEPEND_SRCS DEPEND_LIBS NEW_NAME) 
#   
#     EXE_NAME - the name of the executable.
#     SRCS - source files which will be compiled and linked to the created libraries
#     DEPEND_LIBS - libraries (exception zorba-store libs) to which the created libraries depend on
#     NEW_NAME - If this variable is not equal "", the executables will be renamed to NEW_NAME
#     INSTALL_DESTINATION - if non empty string, the created executable(s) is(are) installed to 
#                           the passed destination
