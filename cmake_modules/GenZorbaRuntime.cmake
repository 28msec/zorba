# This script will either generate a source file from a spec XML file
# (if Zorba is available to process it), or copy a pre-generated
# version from svn.

# Arguments - all are required: 
#  query: Full path to .xq to execute for generation
#  extvars: List of external variables to bind (-e args to zorba)
#  files: List of files to bind to $files in query
#  gen_file: Full path to generated file (in binary dir)
#  ZORBA_EXE: Full path of ZORBA_EXE
#  binary_dir: Full path of CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
#  source_dir: Full path of CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR

# Optional arguments:
#  test_only: If true, we are testing the generation. Generate to a
#  temp location and fail if the generated file is different than the
#  pre-generated form. Note: gen_file must be provided as normal!


# Check if zorbacmd exists and works. We need the ZORBA_EXE and the
# file API for the generation of the runtime and codegen. Zorba will
# fail running the test query if the file API dll is not found in the
# correct location.
