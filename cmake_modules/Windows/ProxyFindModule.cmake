# This macro will try to find a third party library on Windows.
# The parameters must be given the arguments using the following pattern:
#   PARAM_NAME1 param_value1 PARAM_NAME2 param_value1 param_value2 ...
# This macro will further call PARSE_ARGUMENTS to parse it's arguments.
# In the patter above, PARAM_NAME1 will go in the single value parameter pool
# while PARAM_NAME2 will go in the multiple value parameter pool.
#
# Therefore the following parameter names must be provided to this macro:
# Parameters:
#   NAME
#     - mandatory, single value
#     - the value following it will be used to build the CMake module file name.
#     - e.g.: providing NAME "ICU" as parameters, FindICU.cmake will be used for the search.
#   FOUND_VAR
#     - mandatory, single value
#     - the variable that the FindXXX.cmake module sets if the library is found
#     - e.g.: FOUND_VAR "XERCESC_FOUND" when trying to find XercesC
#   SEARCH_NAMES
#     - mandatory, multiple value
#     - the possible directory name fragments that this library can have
#     - e.g.: SEARCH_NAMES "icu" "i_c_u" "uci"
#   COMPONENTS
#     - optional, multiple value
#
# Once done this will define:
#   FOUND_LOCATION - The directory where the library was found
