# - Find the International Components for Unicode (ICU) Library on Windows
#
# This is a proxy module that calls the FindICU.cmake module. Before
# doing that, we try to guess where ICU might be on the user's machine.
# The user should provide ZORBA_THIRD_PARTY_REQUIREMENTS which is a path where
# a the ICU directory can be found. The ICU directory must have "icu"
# (case insensitive) in its name.
#
# This module helps the Windows user to avoid providing the following two
# variables when building Zorba:
# -D ICU_LIBRARY="path_to_3rd_party_dir\*icu*\lib\icuuc.lib"
# -D ICU_DATA_LIBRARY="path_to_3rd_party_dir\*icu*\lib\icudt.lib"
# -D ICU_I18N_LIBRARY="path_to_3rd_party_dir\*icu*\lib\icuin.lib"
# -D ICU_INCLUDE="path_to_3rd_party_dir\*icu*\include"
#
# See the FindICU.cmake module shipped with Zorba for more information.
